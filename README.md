The ProductivityBot is a 3-in-1 Discord bot for your productivity needs. It comes with a build-in pomodoro timer to help structure your workday, a rubber duck debugging function to walk you through your code, and a joke function to relieve stress.
To use ProductivityBot, simply invite the Discord bot to your discord server, then use the commands !timer, !debug, and !joke for their respective functions. 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BOT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT A DISCORD BOT TOKEN. 
-I'm unable to include my bot token since Discord has security settings that automatically invalidate bot tokens that are public on the internet. 
If you want to test the bot on your own, please email me for the token I use at sonnymc@vt.edu, or get a discord bot token at https://discord.com/developers/applications.
